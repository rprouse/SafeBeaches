# Safe Beaches Hamilton #

An application for the Hamilton [Open Data Jam 2014](http://www.softwarehamilton.com/2014/10/24/open-data-jam-2014/) that shows the beaches in Hamilton and tells you if it is safe to swim.

Hamilton currently does not release the water sampling data in an open format, so the results are currently manually screen scrapped.

The website is currently hosted on Azure at http://safebeaches.azurewebsites.net
